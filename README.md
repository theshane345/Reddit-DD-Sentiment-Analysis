This project is a test reddit scraper that will take notes of all the posts with 'DD' (Due Diligence) in the title and figure out how long the post is

The plan is to do sentiment analysis on the posts comments to see if people have reacted positivly to the analysis. 

Seeing which posts had the most positive results and sending this post to me to review the DD itself.

This could limit time in reviewing all posts on various subreddits to see the most reactive DD.


(POSSIBLE FUTURE FEATURES)
get the ticker symbol and check movement over last six months. - if a dd is done on a stock and this stock is currently overbought/overvalued this will need to be checked
webscrape yahoo finance for this.

Create charts to show results rather than in output text
